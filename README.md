# Web-Application-of-Games-to-improve-IQ


Pallankuzhi, Antakshari, Ashtapadha and so on, are the games which bound to evoke nostalgia of our childhood memories. Mostly these generation kids spend their time playing video games in a virtual world like Pubg, clash of clans, racing games. This addiction has brought the classic Indian games to the brink of extinction. Sadly, today’s kids are so engrossed in playing video games that traditional games have been completely forgotten.

So we have designed some traditional games for both children and adults. These games are implemented on a website superior to mobile applications because of its compatibility, accessibility and even offline access. And Due to the multi-device support that responsive web design provides across various platforms, it's becoming easier to reach a broader audience. 

Our main aim is to make users benefitted from these games. Thus we have established a connection between these games and our intelligence. Logical (2048 Game, Tic Tac Toe), Cognitive (Chess), Memory (Memory Game), Instinctive (Rock Paper Scissors, Snake & Apple), Composure (Carom, Archery Game) are the important aspects of measuring intelligence during an IQ-test. Playing these intelligence games is seen as one of the more creative ways of boosting our cognitive potential. They help boost your problem-solving abilities and give exercise to our brain. The chess board is designed with the help of AI such that the player will be playing with the computer and also when the cursor is hovered on a particular piece it shows all the possible way in which that piece can be moved according to the rules of the game.
  
Dr. Susanne Jaggi Dual N once revealed that players who regularly played these types of games for at least 25 minutes every day saw a 4-point increase in their IQ score. So, start indulging yourself and your children with fun memory games for adults and kids, just don’t forget that you will have to work tomorrow and your kid needs to be in bed by eight.
