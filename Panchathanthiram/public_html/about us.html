                <p>Pachisis, Pallankuzhi, Antakshari, Ashtapadha, Poruthi Vilayadu and so on, are the games which bound
                    to evoke nostalgia of our childhood memories. Mostly these generation kids spend their time playing
                    video games in a virtual world like Pubg, clash of clans, racing games and so on. This addiction has
                    brought the classic Indian games mentioned above, and many others, to the brink of extinction. Sadly,
                    today’s kids are so engrossed in playing video games that traditional games have been completely forgotten.<br><br>
                    So we designed these ancient games for both children and adults in order to evoke nostalgia of their 
                    childhood memories. Here we implemented all these games on a website superior to mobile applications
                    because of its compatibility, accessibility and even offline access. And Due to the multi-device support 
                    that responsive web design provides across various platforms, it's becoming easier to reach a broader audience.<br><br>
                    Our main aim is to make users benefitted from these games. So we have established a connection between these 
                    games and our intelligence. Logical, Cognitive, memory, instinctive, composure are the important aspects of 
                    measuring intelligence during an IQ-test.<br>
                <li>
                    Logical - Helps you make important decisions, discern the truth, solve problems, come up with new ideas and set achievable goals. <br></li>
                <li>Cognitive - Tests the mental ability of perception, planning and judgment.<br></li>
                <li>   Composure games - Tests the self-controlled state of mind, calmness and tranquility. <br></li>
                <li>    Memory games - Tests the ability to juggle multiple thoughts or memories at one time.<br></li>
                <li>    Instinctive is the most important leadership skill.<br></li><br>
                    Playing these intelligence games is seen as one of the more creative ways of boosting
                    our cognitive potential. They help boost your problem-solving abilities and give exercise to our brain.<br><br>
                    Dr. Susanne Jaggi Dual N once revealed that players who regularly played these types of games for at least 25 
                    minutes every day saw a 4-point increase in their IQ score. There was even a study where children with dyslexia 
                    showed vast improvement when they were made to play these memory games for at least 12 hours. Intelligence games 
                    are generally favored by parents who are looking for effective ways to teach their young children. 
                    So, start indulging yourself and your children with fun memory games for adults and kids, just don’t forget that
                    you will have to work tomorrow and your kid needs to be in bed by eight.<br><br>
